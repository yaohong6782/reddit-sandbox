# My Reddit Playground
Diving into typescript with some design UIs\
Small development utilising design libraries and frameworks


# Why?
Dislike needing to sign into Reddit just to view it for approximately < 30seconds\
Made it so I can switch threads easily and view the information which I need for some juice for the day :D\
I like old reddit but enjoys new reddit capability to play videos without navigating to the thread, so I decided to try get best of both


**Utilised**
* ChakraUI

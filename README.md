Diving into typescript with some design UIs\
Small development utilising emerging libraries and frameworks\

Bored of needing to sign into Reddit just to view it for approximately < 30seconds\
Made it so I can switch threads easily get some juice for the day :D 

**Utilised**
* [ChakraUI]
* [TailWind]

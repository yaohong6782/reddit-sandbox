# My Reddit Playground
Diving into typescript with some design UIs\
Small development utilising emerging libraries and frameworks

# Why?
Bored of needing to sign into Reddit just to view it for approximately < 30seconds\
I like old reddit but like new reddit ability to play videos, so I decided to try get best of both\
Made it so I can switch threads easily get some juice for the day :D 

**Utilised**
